Solution to the 'chess piece on a keypad generating a phone number' problem.

Solution consists of Piece classes to generate the total number of combinations and the KeypadSolver class to combine these into a straight forward function to return the total number of phone numbers, depending on the name of the piece specified.

Example usage can be found in the SampleKeypadSolver class.

Implementation of pawn class is missing due to time constraints.
